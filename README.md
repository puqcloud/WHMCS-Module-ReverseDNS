The ReverseDNS module for WHMCS allows your clients to fully manage rDNS (PTR) records for their virtual machines, dedicated servers, or entire IP address space directly from the client area.

This module uses PowerDNS as the backend and supports multi-server setups, meaning different reverse zones can be hosted on different DNS servers — all managed seamlessly within a single service.

**Key Features:**

- Full rDNS management via client area
- PowerDNS backend integration
- Multi-server support for reverse zones
- Supports both "Dedicated IP" and "Additional IPs" fields
- Subnet (CIDR) management support
- Solves the lack of native rDNS management in WHMCS

This module provides a complete solution for reverse DNS control in WHMCS.

>⚠️ *Important:*  
> In the first version of the module, rDNS management for **IPv6** addresses is **not supported**.  
> Only IPv4 reverse DNS records can be managed at this time.
