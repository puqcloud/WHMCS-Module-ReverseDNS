# Product Information

In the admin area, under the product management section, you can view a complete list of all client-assigned IP addresses and their corresponding rDNS records.

Just like in the client area, administrators have the ability to edit rDNS records directly from this interface.  
All changes are instantly applied to the PowerDNS server.
